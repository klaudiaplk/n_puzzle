# N_puzzle Solver

BFS and A star algorithms were used in the n puzzle solver.
N_puzzle solver was tested only in Python3.6.

# Virtual environment
It is recommended to create virtualenva to install the appropriate python versions and libraries used in the program and described in the requirements.txt file. An example of creating a virtual environment:
```
virtualenv -p python3.6 .venv_name
```

# Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/klaudiaplk/n_puzzle.git
cd pszt_n_puzzle
pip install .
```

# Usage
We can run the script using the command:
```
n_puzzle --algorithm-name ALGORITHM_NAME [--heuristic HEURISTIC] [--generation-board] [--board-height BOARD_HEIGHT] [--file-path FILE_PATH] --save-path SAVE_PATH
```
Parameters that are required and parameters that is optional to run the n_puzzle solver:
```
--algorithm-name -> [str] The name of the algorithm we want to use to find a solution for the n_puzzle. Choose from bfs or a_star.
--heuristic -> [str] The name of the heuristic we want to use for the A star algorithm. Choose from manhattan or misplaces_tiles; if you choose the BFS search algorithm, this argument should be bypassed.
--generation-board -> [bool] The argument responsible for generating the board by the program.
--board-height -> [int] Board height; when loading the board from a file this parameter should be omitted - it will be loaded from the file.
--file-path -> [str] Path to the file containing information about the board; enter when generating a board from a file.
--save-path -> [str] Path to record steps leading to the solution
```
Parameters that are required to properly run the solver for the A star algorithm and the board is generated by the program:
```
--algorithm-name
--heuristic
--generation-board
--board-height
--save-path
```

Parameters that are required to properly run the solver for the A star algorithm and the board is is read from the file:
```
--algorithm-name
--heuristic
--file-path
--save-path
```

Parameters that are required to properly run the solver for the BFS algorithm and the board is generated by the program:

```
--algorithm-name
--generation-board
--board-height
--save-path
```

Parameters that are required to properly run the solver for the BFS algorithm and the board is is read from the file:
```
--algorithm-name
--file-path
--save-path
```
